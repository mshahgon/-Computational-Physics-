# -Computational-Physics-
Code for Applications in Physics
*Here we have a repository to collect code used in many applications surround the physics domain. 
Our objective here is to create a computational 'toolbox' that we can access when needed.
Please feel free to add any code (general or specialized) in ay language of interest. Most code will
be added in the Python and MatLab language bases.*
